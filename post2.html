                        <p>In the speech delivered by W. Bradford Wilcox entitled "Mammon or Marriage," a profound lesson illuminated the significance of marriage for the well-being of both men and women. Amidst the prevailing narrative in today's world that portrays marriage as a hindrance to individual fulfillment, Wilcox debunked this notion with compelling evidence and insightful perspectives.</p>
                        <p>Wilcox shared research findings that underscored the immense benefits of marriage. Among these findings, one study revealed that married individuals in their 50s tend to possess approximately ten times the assets of their unmarried counterparts. Moreover, marriage emerged as a superior predictor of happiness compared to factors such as education, employment, and financial status. According to the General Social Survey spanning from 2014 to 2018, the odds of experiencing happiness increased by a staggering 151% for married individuals, with the likelihood soaring even higher—up to 545%—for those in deeply fulfilling marriages.</p>
                        <p>By listening to Wilcox's speech, I gained a profound appreciation for the pivotal role of marriage. On top of what Wilcox shared though, marriage is also particularly powerful when viewed through the lens of eternity. While marriage undoubtedly offers profound joy and fulfillment during this life on earth, the knowledge that it can endure beyond the bounds of this probationary period, through the eternal principles taught in the gospel of Jesus Christ, shows its unparalleled significance.</p>
                        <p>Through the eternal perspective of marriage, we recognize it not only as a source of earthly happiness but also as a sacred covenant that transcends time and space. It becomes a conduit for spiritual growth, companionship, and mutual support, enriching our lives in ways that extend far beyond the temporal time we have here on earth.</p>
